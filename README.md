# Brancacci Chapel Ontology

Repository hosting the OWL Ontology for heterogeneous cultural heritage management and cultural site reconstruction applied to the Brancacci Chapel (current version: 0.9.0).

`PREFIX: https://w3id.org/cnr-ispc/ontology/branco#`

This repository contains the full documentation produced during the development of the ontology. In particular:
- the ```docs``` directory contains all the files related to the ontology and its versions in time;
- the ```samod``` directory contains the material produced during SAMOD iterations.

The ontology directly reuses [CIDOC-CMR](https://www.cidoc-crm.org/html/cidoc_crm_v7.1.3.html), [CRM-DIG](https://ontome.net/namespace/211), and [HICO](https://marilenadaquino.github.io/hico/#d4e318):
