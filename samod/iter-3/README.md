**#3 The interpretative act supporting the US and its properties**

*Scenario*

A stratigraphic unit has different kinds of properties. These are assigned in an interpretative process which is carried out by an agent and is supported by different citations (different things can be the object of this citation). Each interpretation is motivated by a specific criterion such as comparison with other physical objects, diagnostic data, archival sources, general rules. Stratigraphic unit properties can be of different type, such as material, placement, iconography and dimension. 

*Examples*

1. In the final reconstruction, the position of the statue of Venus in the atrium of the domus B is justified by the position of the statue of Venus in the domus C
2. The Eastern Wall of domus B used to be decorated: on the basis of the instructions written by Vitruvius, the decoration might have been composed of seven layers of plaster beneath the pictorial film.
3. A diagnostic campaign demonstrated that the Western wall of domus B should have been decorated twice, identifying one layer of decoration beneath the outer pictorial film
4. Given the thickness of the Western wall and comparison with other sites, researchers claim that it should be 3.5 m tall. 


*Competency Questions*

1. Which is the criterion and the cited object in the reconstruction of the location of the Venus in domus B?
2. Which are the sources and criterion for the reconstruction of the domus B?
3. Which is the hypothesised height of the Western wall of the domus B?
